// Package vitess is an automatic filter-branch, of the great Vitess project.
//
// The goal is keeping the `github.com/youtube/vitess/go/mysql` package and all
// the dependent packages as a standalone versioned golang library, to be used
// by other projects.
//
// It holds all the packages to create your own MySQL server and a full SQL
// parser.
package vitess // import "gopkg.in/src-d/go-vitess.v1"
