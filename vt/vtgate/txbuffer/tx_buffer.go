Package txbuffer contains experimental logic to buffer transactions in VTGate.
Only the Begin statement of transactions will be buffered.

The reason why it might be useful to buffer transactions is during failovers:
the master vttablet can become unavailable for a few seconds. Upstream clients
(e.g., web workers) might not retry on failures, and instead may prefer for VTGate to wait for
a few seconds for the failover to complete. Thiis will block upstream callers for that time,
but will not return transient errors during the buffering time.
