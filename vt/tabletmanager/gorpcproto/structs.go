/*

This file contains the structures used to pack the RPC args and reply
for the gorpc transport for tablet manager.

Arguments are composed of the name of the call + Args.
Replies are composed of the name of the call + Reply.
If a struct is used as both Arguments and Replies, use name of the call + Data.

NOTE(alainjobart) It is OK to rename a structure, as the type is not
passed in through the RPC. I tested that by creating another set of
structures here, adding a '2' to the end of the types, and changing
gorpc_server.go to only use the '2' structures. Everything worked the same.
